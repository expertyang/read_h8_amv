C       The following module is used to share information between
C       subroutine FDEBUFR and subroutine OPENBT, since the latter
C       is not called by the former but rather is called directly
C       from within the NCEP BUFRLIB.

        MODULE Share_Table_Info
            CHARACTER*120       ctbldir
            INTEGER             ltbd, ludx
        END MODULE
